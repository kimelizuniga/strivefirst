                    The idea for starting Strive First came when Yves was living in Kingston, ON while completing his final year of high school in 2014. Yves was a very hardworking individual. There's no physical job that passed by that he didn't do. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yves discovered moving while helping his best friend's brother. He enjoyed working with the team and his friend's brother. Over the next few months, Yves got so fascinated with the service and wanted to help his friends gain work ethics and experience. With the help of his friends, Yves was able to create a side moving business that following year. He took a year off serving residents of Kingston and Students at Queen's University who referred him to their friends through word of mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, Yves was selecting Universities to attend. He ended up attending one in Manitoba for  Bachelor of Business Administration and Aviation. While in Manitoba, he was still being contacted by the students at Queen's for his services. Unfortunately, no one was able to help him carry the business in Kingston so it died slowly with fewer responses from the clients in Kingston.
                </p>

                    Yves' program price started to increase and the federal government decline on increasing the loan to support the remainder of the program due to the university being private. Yves had no choice but to leave Manitoba that very second semester to attend an institution in Ontario. He ends up attending Trent University in 2016 located in Peterborough where he met Gman who encouraged Yves to continue his journey with the moving services. Gman was able to see Yves' ambitions through his eyes and the passion he carried for the business. Yves was able to inspire 3 of his friend to pursue moving and painting jobs while in school to help raise funds to support their day-to-day activities. While at Trent Yves joined WUSC a program that helps international students integrate into the communities. He was able to utilize the school community with the help of his friends to establish connections within the Peterborough community serving majorly students even from this day on Students in Peterborough still call Yves for his services. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 upon graduation from Trent University, Yves realized to better expand what is now known as <b class="colRed">Student's Moving Services</b>. He had to relocate to Ottawa. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>
                Ottawa created a lot of challenges that Yves embraced. He needed a vehicle to continue the moving services. He was able to secure his dad's van at the time. He continued hassling with the help of a fellow friend Luc. They hassled day and night with the van taking on impossible moving and doing more than two rounds pick up and drop off. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Luckily along the road, Yves discovers Help with Furniture (HWF) a local charity donor that helps to furnish homes to people in need in Ottawa. Partnering with HWF helped SMS gain access to new contacts and opened the doors to meeting potential business customers and partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make Student's Moving Services a reality, Yves registered the Ontario business license and also registered for his business number and GST/HST number from Canada Revenue Agency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yves made a sacrifice and managed to trade his Kia Rio in 2020 for a Dodge Ram which had the towing capacity needed to get the ongoing jobs. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In the last seven months Yves has manged to served clients ranging from low income to high income some from abroad, the local government, and the majority of newcomers to Canada and residence of Canada. He also was able to help the municipal government organizations. <b>The customer's feedback drives Yves to continue doing what he does best</b>.
